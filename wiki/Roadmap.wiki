#summary Where is stpivot going to?
#labels Featured

We are constantly looking for improvements to STPivot, putting special attention in feedbacks from final users.


Current roadmap includes:


- Release a new branch independent from Pentaho, so other projects using JPivot can also benefit from STPivot.

- Upgrade charting engine, perhaps using some new javaScript library such as HighCharts.

- Build a new PivotComponentView for Pentaho, to enhance definition of clickables and XML/A mode

- Improve stats summary when selecting table cells

- Rewrite the whole frontend, using dojo as the foundation for user interface.

- Replace jpivot tags and libraries for those provided by Olap4j, alog with the possibility to interact with a wider range of OLAP providers.
